		<h1>Focus Time</h1>
		<h2>
			Design and Web Development Project<br>
			UC San Diego (COGS 120: Interaction Design)
		</h2>
		<br>
		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>
			In our day and age, mobile phones are ubiquitous. They let us communicate, learn, and interact with the world at large at all times of the day, no matter the place. At the same time, however, they are a great source of distraction. Texts, push notifications, and social media apps threaten to take our attention away at any second.
			<br><br>And that’s not to say we don’t do our best to handle it. Given how convenient it is to get completely sidetracked on our phones, we make a good effort—plotting out times in our schedule get things done. Yet, the best laid plans are ultimately still fallible to human errors, it’s only natural. 
			To convert our best efforts into better outcomes, what students really need is that extra step, something to hold them to their own promises.
			<br><br><b>Students should have a way to keep track of their work time, and establish their own incentives the way they know best.</b>
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Examining the Problem</h2>
		<p>As a team, we decided to research the roots of the problem where it was most prevalent—with students at UC San Diego’s own campus. We reached out to several students to ask for their experiences when it came to smartphones and studying.

		<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
		<p>In our attempts to create a new time management and productivity app, we considered what worked and what didn’t when it came to preexisting apps out there. 
		</p>
		<img src="imgs/Comp Analysis.png" style="width: 60%;">
		<div style="z-index:-1;margin-top:-440px;margin-left:250px;width:40%">A consistent problem we found in these examples and similar services was the gamification of productivity. While turning these productivity sessions into a game may seem fun at first, they ultimately pull users’ attention away from the true purpose of the tasks they set out to do. 
			<br><br>Combined with the inclusion of micro-transactions, these focus apps become just what they market themselves as—a game.
			We wanted to avoid this as much as possible, and decided to on instead focus on these factors after our competitive analysis:
			<ul>
				<li>Keeping the interface and concept simple</li>
				<li>Eliminate potential work-arounds</li>
				<li>Encouraging good habits over time</li>
				<li>Reviewing one’s progress</li>
	
			</ul>
